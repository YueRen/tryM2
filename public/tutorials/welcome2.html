  <h4>Getting started in Singular</h4>

  <p>In this tutorial, we will show how to use this web site effectively.</p>

  <p>Every tutorial usually consists of a number of pages, with highlighted Singular
  code.</p>
  
  <p>If you click or tap on the highlighted Singular code, the code will
  be sent to the server, and evaluated.  The result will be displayed in the right hand window.
  For example</p>

  <code>2+2;</code><br>
    <code>LIB "poly.lib";</code><br>
    <code>ring r=32003,(a,b,c,d,e,f),lp;</code><br>
    <code>ideal I=cyclic(6);</code><br>
    <code>ideal sI=std(I);</code><br>
    <code>sI;</code><br>

  <p>If you are already familiar with Singular and know some commands, you 
    can type them directly in the right hand window. </p>
    
    
  <p>You are on the first page of this tutorial.  At the top of the window, you see how many pages are
  in this tutorial.  After you are finished with a page, click or tap on the right arrow key.  You can also go back to previous pages of the tutorial by clicking on the left arrow button.</p>

<!--   <h4>Getting Singular help on a topic</h4> -->

<!--   <p>There are two main ways of getting help on a topic in Singular.  The first method gives you -->
<!--   text help in the Singular output window.  For example,</p> -->

<!--   <p>This displays in the Singular output window how to use the function "determinant". -->
<!--   <b>Note!</b> In many browsers, you will have scroll bars to go back, but in some, notably most versions -->
<!--   of Safari, the scrollbars are there but hidden! -->
<!--   </p> -->

<!--   <p>Alternatively, and more usefully, you may obtain the web version by using:</p> -->

<!--   <p>This opens the documentation page in another browser window or tab.  You can surf through the links -->
<!--   there to see other Singular documentation.</p> -->

<!--   <p>Depending on your browser settings, you may be navigated to this new page, -->
<!--   or not.  Your Singular web session is still active in any case! You might -->
<!--   need to disable popup window blocking in your browser in order to get the -->
<!--   help page.</p> -->

<!-- </div> -->

<div>
    <h4>Using the <b>Input</b> Window</h4>


  <p>When you write Singular functions or long loops, it is often more convenient to write your code
    in a separate window and execute the code after you wrote it. This allows you to easily modify previous code and 
    move the cursor around freely. </p>
    
    <p>Clicking or tapping the <b>Input</b> button at the top of the page, navigates you to the Input Window.
  This is where you may type in Singular code and have it evaluated.</p>
 
   <p>In that window, place your cursor on a line that you wish to evaluate, and either click the
  <b>Evaluate</b> button, or press Shift-Return (both keys at the same time).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you may select several lines, or a part of a line, and clicking
  <b>Evaluate</b> (or press Shift-Return) will evaluate the selection.</p>

  <p>You try it!  Click <b>Input</b>, type in some Singular input, or try out some of the example
  lines already there.  When you are ready to come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the
  <b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page.  You will end up right here!

   <p><b>To save your work:</b>
  Click on the <b>Save</b> button at the top right of the window.  A dialog will appear
  where you can save the text in the <b>Input</b> window, or the text in the Singular output (or both).
  Alternatively, you can just select the text you wish, and copy it.
  </p>

<div>
  <h4>Singular sessions and the Reset button</h4>
  
  <p> When your browser starts, it starts a Singular process on our server.
  All of your input, either typed and evaluated, or run by pressing buttons,
  goes to this process.  If you open a second window or tab in the same
  browser, you will get the same session.
  </p>

  <p>
  You might wish to start fresh, or restart Singular, if a computation is
  going on too long.  In this case, press the <b>Reset</b> button at the top of
  the page.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you first connect to this web site, a cookie is generated, and that is used to connect to
  your Singular process on the server.  If you quit your browser, and it is set to remember windows, then
  it remembers the cookie, and you can reconnect back to the same session.  If not, then a new session
  is created.  The server will remove the session after some length of time, currently several days or a week.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sometimes the server must be restarted for maintenance or other reasons, and at those times, all sessions
  are terminated.
  </p>

  <h4>Advanced topics</h4>
  <h4>Uploading files</h4>

  <p>Use the <b>Upload File</b> button to upload files to the Singular server that can then be loaded into your Singular session. Suppose that you have uploaded a file named <tt>foo.lib</tt> which contains Singular code.
  You may then load this file into Singular using either:
  </p>
  
  <code>load "foo.lib"</code><br>

  <p>
  or, if you wish to see all of the lines executed one by one:
  </p>
  
  <code>input "foo.lib"</code><br>

  
  <p><b>Note</b>: these lines will likely give errors now, as the file
    <tt>foo.lib</tt> probably doesn't exist on the server!</p>

  <h4>Running shell commands in your Singular session</h4>

  <p>It is possible to run shell commands from within Singular, although many operations are restricted.
  For example, to see what files you have in your home directory on the server, try:</p>

  <h4>Singular and image files</h4>

  <p>Sometimes Singular or one of its packages generates image files.
  For example, the displayGraph function below creates a jpeg file.
  </p>


  <h4>Getting files back to your machine</h4>

  <p>
  Sometimes your Singular code will create a file as output.  How to download
  this onto your machine?  Here is one way.  This first line creates a file for
  the purpose of this example.
  </p>
  

  <p>The next line will present a download dialog for you to obtain the file on your machine.
  </p>
  

  <h4>Restrictions in place for the Singular server</h4>

  <p>The server is being shared with other users, therefore memory and CPU time
  are limited (generous, but limited).  Other restrictions include: upload file size, number of processes that
  can run, and the amount of time that the session is saved on the server.
  </p>
